_Recreation Kit_ Modules
========================

_‘Recreation Kit’_ (codename) is a project about playground games like tag and hide-and-seek, and how to create new ones with a modular gameplay system. The ‘Modules’ part aims to define all the possible modules that are going to be used in the project outcomes — as in the ‘_Recreation Kit_ Cards’ and the ‘_Recreation Kit_ Map’.
