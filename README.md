_Tag Mixing_ Modules
====

_‘Tag Mixing Kit’_ is a project about playground games like tag and hide-and-seek, and how to design new ones with a modular gameplay system. These modules are the building blocks used in every outcome from the project, as in the _Tag Mixing_ Cards, the _Tag Mixing_ Map, and the the _Tag Mixing_ App ([repository](https://github.com/nclm/tagmixing-app)).
